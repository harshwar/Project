# My Multi-Module Project

This repository contains two main modules: a Hardhat project for smart contracts and a Vue.js frontend for an NFT viewer.

## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/harshwar/Project.git](https://github.com/harshwar/Project.git)
    ```
2.  **Install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This single command installs all dependencies for both the frontend and the Hardhat project.

3.  **Run the project locally:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the development server for your frontend.

4.  **Deploy the smart contract (Hardhat):**
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
